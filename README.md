# Tutoring-Web-app
Tutoring web-app made to act as a bridge between tutors, and students seeking to connect. 

Having originated from an organization, this repository was cloned into a personal Github. All of the work contained was a collaborative effort by my team, as well as by myself for academic purposes.
